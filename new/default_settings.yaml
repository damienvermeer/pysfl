project:
  name: 'Example Solar Farm'

#Overall details for the solar farm site
site:
  azimuth: 0 #angle from true north for rows, set to 0 for no rotation
  setback: 10 #meters to set rows back from edge, set to 0 for no setback

#Configuration for roads within the solar farm
roads:
  perimeter:
    road-width: 5 #m, width of perimeter roadway, set to 0 if not required
    clear-width: 8 #m, width of clearway for road, must be >=road-width
    turn-radius: 0 #m, minimum turn radius of the roadway. 0=no smoothing

solar:
  spacing:
    post-to-post: 6 #m, spacing between center of solar row and its neighbour
    edge-offset: 0 #m, one-off shift for all solar rows from edge
  module:
    dim-length: 2 #m, long side of module length
    dim-width: 1 #m, short side of module length
